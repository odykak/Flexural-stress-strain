# Stress-strain
Reads force - displacement data and, in a new folder, plots:
- stress - strain curves
- the elastic region for each sample
- bar charts for each sample and material
- saves the different data files in different sheets within an Excel file

"Stress-strain" is the file to run. The rest of the files starting with a number are data.

Make sure to adjust the paths in the code.
